            <p>The Dry Dock would stand out anywhere. A wooden fishing boat repurposed into a bar and eatery isn’t exactly something you’d expect to see when walking down the street, especially in landlocked Leicester. </p>

            <p>It’s location, sandwiched between a sprawling industry estate and a grey retail park housing a Homebase/Argos and a Halfords, only exacerbates its uniqueness.</p>


            <p>The large glass panes and perfect symmetry of the ever-growing student housing development that towers over the bar, almost creeping up on it, contrasts with the verging on dilapidated outward appearance of The Dry Dock.  </p>
            <p>Established over twenty years ago, just how exactly The Dry Dock ship came to be stranded on a pavement in Leicestershire has become a popular guessing game for locals and tourists alike.
            </p>Theories range from the absurd. One regular is convinced it was blown here by a particularly strong wind (though perhaps his opinion was being heavily influenced by his fifth or so pint).  </p>
          </p>Alternatively, many patriots are convinced that the original owner didn’t want to pay for harbour space for his boat so decided to convert it into a bar.  </p>

            <p>
                Finding the actual truth behind the bar’s origins is a tough task, even the staff don’t have the answers. With one barman claiming that nobody knows and that’s the way the boss likes it. </p>

             <p>
                Just off Leicester’s bustling Welford Road, at the top of Putney Road, The Dry Dock is a sort of well-known secret for city locals. </p>
            <p>It’s just out of the way enough that you might not stumble upon it naturally, but if you happen to you’ll make sure your friends join you for a few at the dock. </p>
            <p>The actual boat part of the bar doesn’t contain the whole establishment. While that would certainly be novel, where would the kitchen go? Or the bar itself? In fact, there would probably only be room for a few tables at a squeeze, the bar would be out of business in a month Tasha (one of the friendly bar staff) points out.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                It’s a marvel to behold, or perhaps that’s the alcohol talking.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Instead a small brick fixture has been adjoined to the boat in a sort of Frankenstein’s monster type creation. When you first lay eyes upon the establishment it’s could be described as an “eye sore” as in fact one women drinking out front did label it as such.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, there’s a strange beauty to The Dock after a while, you start to appreciate that it’s not a gimmick. It’s a madman’s conception.
            </p>

            <p>
              It’s a genuine wooden boat that has been stripped of its inner working and repurposed into a bar purely because it could be done, rather than for any architectural sense.
           </p>
            <p>
                It’s a marvel to behold, or perhaps that’s the alcohol talking. They do serve a mean Long Island ice tea.  </p>

              </p> Before you even enter The Dry Dock there’s the oddities outside to take in. Its doorstep is one of Leicester’s premium beer gardens, and in the summer, is positively overflowing with patriots lapping up the small trickle of sun that shines on Leicester every year. </p>

            </p> Though calling it a “garden” may be rather generous, it’s actually a concrete terrace with a curious snakes and ladders board painted on its red and grey titles. Giving bored children something to do, once they get tired of running up and down the metal steps to the top of the boat. </p>

          </p> There are two entry points to The Dry Dock. The main entrance which leads you straight to the bar and the balcony entrance that takes you right into the heart of the ship. </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Once you’ve ascending the metal stairs onto the black paint coated balcony, your entrance to The Dock are the crumbling double doors to the boats top cabin with chipped white paint and hinges so loose there’s a real chance you’ll pull the doors right out of their frame.  </p>

            <p> This cabin, that was presumably once boat’s bridge, is big enough for only a single sofa and table. Your chances of landing this spot on a busy night (or even a quiet one) is remote but it’s the best place to take in such a strange watering hole. </p>

          <p> Downstairs the rest of the bar is equally in keeping with the kooky exterior. From the pinball machine advertising a movie that is ten years old to the array of ship steering wheels affixed to the walls. </p>

            <p> The unique lay out of a boat doesn’t exactly lend itself to table and chairs so the staff have got creative. The curve of the ship at either end has been turned into semi-circle booths and the narrow framework has given rise to high tables and chairs. <p>

           </p> Perhaps it’s the kebab stall merely five metres away, once a temporary van now a permanent fixture, or maybe it’s because The Dry Dock is so close to Filbert Street that you can hear the crowd roar when Jamie Vardy scores but the bar has become the go to place for a pre-match pint. <p>

           </p> Welford Road, home of the Tigers, is also only a stone’s throw away which means when it’s a home football and rugby weekend forget getting a seat. </p>
</p> </p>

</p> </p>
         </p> One final little oddity worth mentioning is that the whole ceiling of the boat is retractable. It’s a tad pointless to be honest notes the bar’s manager, but some of the football lads love it and in helps clear the smell of fresher’s week students out quicker. </p>

         </p> Sadly, The Dry Dock may not be long for this world, as the University of Leicester wants to knock the place down in order to expand upon it’s never ending quest to turn as much of the city as possible into student housing. </p>

       </p> There’s been a valiant push back to the news from regulars of the bar, and also the local community that don’t want to lose one of the more interesting drinking establishments in the city.  </p>

       </p> The fate of The Dry Dock remains to be seen however it’s hoped the bar can be saved. The proposed plan of expanding freeman’s common may bring new wealth into the area but it’ll destroy some of the local favour that makes the community tick. </p>

      </p> While it may be an eyesore to some, if a building is measured in character than The Dry Dock is arguable one of the most architecturally intriguing in the whole of the East Midlands. </p>
